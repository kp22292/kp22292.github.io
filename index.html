		When you are young, your parents and teachers always tell you to create goals. They say that regardless of the troubles that may come your way, once you set your mind to a goal, you will achieve it. My lifetime goal is to be a petroleum engineer. As a petroleum engineer, Iâ€™ll work to develop new types of drills to help dig deeper, faster, and more efficiently. I also hope to create a new transportation system that helps move petroleum with minimal environmental degradation. I can even help create new compounds to make oil rigs more durable. In order to accomplish these feats, I must rely on past knowledge while attaining a deep understanding of engineering and petroleum science.

		This may seem odd coming from a high school student, but I believe my past experiences are just as important as my future training in helping me achieve my goals. As a former member of the Robotics Team, I was in charge of the field build team. I helped gather all of the supplies and make a playable field for our robot to practice on. I was also on the design team so I got to help design the robot in regards to how it would function and score points. In addition, by participating in an engineering camp through the National Student Leadership Conference, I was able to work with electronics and create smaller robots. I was able to use my knowledge from Science Olympiad and my physics classes to create a trebuchet using six feet of PVC pipe and a dowel rod. Finally, through activities such as Boy Scouts of America, Taekwondo, Speech and Debate, and Model Atlanta Regional Commission, I have been able to work on my public speaking skills, various outdoor skills, and leadership skills that will help me work with my team/group better and more efficiently.

		Although past events may be important, the education and training I will receive through a Petroleum Engineering program will help me reach my goal. I will be able to learn the properties of fossil fuels. I will be able to learn about the earth and grasp a better understanding of geology. I will be able to continue learning calculus and will be able to learn more about physics than I have in high school. I will be able to learn about material science. I will be able to enhance my knowledge on thermodynamics and fluids. I will be able to learn about drills and rigs and how they work. The knowledge from a Petroleum Engineering program is endless and my experiences and advancements towards my goal will be the same.

		Knowing that I am now at a stage where my parents and teachers do not need to tell me what my goals are is a liberating experience. I can make my own decisions and I know I am making the right ones, especially regarding my decision to be a Petroleum Engineer.
